# Automated Productivity Tips
A solution for automatically posting daily/weekly series of tips to a SharePoint site (list), Power App, and/or Engage community.
Developed for the 75th anniversary of the NHS in the UK, it can be adapted for any series of productivity tips. The zip files are one for 75 tips for the NHS anniversary in Scotland, and one generic set of 60 tips for any organisation.
Each zip contains a doc with full installation instructions.
